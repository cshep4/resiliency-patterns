# Distributed Systems Patterns in Go

A comprehensive collection of examples and demonstrations showcasing different techniques and design patterns for building resilient distributed systems in Go.

## Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of common distributed systems patterns, focusing on reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Each pattern includes working code examples, explanations, and best practices for real-world applications.

## Patterns Covered

### Resilience Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker** - Prevent cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to failing services
- **Retry with Backoff** - Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Timeout Management** - Proper timeout handling for network operations
- **Bulkhead** - Isolate resources to prevent total system failure

### Communication Patterns
- **Request-Response** - Synchronous communication patterns
- **Publish-Subscribe** - Asynchronous messaging patterns
- **Message Queues** - Reliable message delivery and processing
- **Event Sourcing** - Event-driven architecture patterns

### Data Patterns
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Saga Pattern** - Distributed transaction management
- **Event Sourcing** - Storing state as a sequence of events
- **Database Per Service** - Data isolation in microservices

### Observability Patterns
- **Health Checks** - Service health monitoring
- **Metrics Collection** - Application and system metrics
- **Distributed Tracing** - Request tracing across services
- **Structured Logging** - Consistent logging practices

### Deployment Patterns
- **Blue-Green Deployment** - Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Releases** - Gradual rollout strategies
- **Service Discovery** - Dynamic service registration and discovery
- **Load Balancing** - Traffic distribution strategies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker (for running examples with external dependencies)
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/distributed-systems-patterns-go.git
cd distributed-systems-patterns-go
go mod download
```

### Running Examples

Each pattern includes runnable examples:

```bash
# Run a specific pattern example
cd patterns/resilience/circuit-breaker
go run main.go

# Run tests for all patterns
go test ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...
```
